# Python Basics


Computers to function wait for us to tell them what to do. Literally they wait for our set of instructions to function. Programming is writing a set of instructions for computers to follow in a specific language to tell them what to do next. It is a very creative process and an attestation to human ingenuity, creativity and intuition.

As a new learner, I chose the Python programming language to solve data problems,to be more productive in handling the data and information that I will encounter.

I feel it will be  valuable to have a self-contained library that has the overview of some of the most important features of Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures and libraries from the perspective of data.

The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, and it has become the essential tool for many programmers, especially new learners and data scientists. If there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are Python language offers excellent resources for learning the language, high level lang capabilities, numerous  tools and packages, and now a growing literature on data science, data analysis, and machine learning which accompany those needs. Python is a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets.
